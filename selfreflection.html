            <h1>Self Reflection</h1>
            <p>Lesson learned in this assignment are huge! I have learned that every single website, no matter how professional and famous/recognized it is, has its flaws. Some developers, although having a clear 
                plan for their website, may have not thought of certain things that they might be missing out on. Something that I really learned was also making the website 
                user-friendly so that even if you aren't tech savvy, you have difficulties with certain things or you have a condition such as visual impairment, 
                are deaf or need other special help, the resources for that should also be there, such as a speaker button so that people that can't read really well or are 
                deaf can have the website read aloud to them. That's just one example. Overall, I have also learned that usability testing is very important. Although professional 
                developers and other might test a website, a real user that hasn't seen or touch the website before, should know what the website is about at first glance 
                and should also be able to use the website easily and comfortably. Thank you! I have loved this class and assignment. Thank you Dr. Walters for all of your help and patience!
