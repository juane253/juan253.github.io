            <h2>To improve Amazon.com, the following are steps that can be taken:</h2>
            <h3>1. Add a continue as guest button or simply not ask to sign in at all</h3>
            <h3>2. Make sure all languages of movies are in the "details" option</h3>
            <h3>3. Make sure there aren't a bunch of ads scattered throughout the website, especially in the main page</h3>
            <h3>4. Make the headers/tabs easier to understand and not have the names of them be misleading. For example, instead of just "New Releases" specify by adding "Items" to the name to have it say "New Item Releases" or "New Merch"</h3>
            <h3>5. Add a chat box to talk to a representative when what you're looking for is not in the FAQ</h3>
            <h3>6. Place options where they are easier to find, some of them are just buried within other options</h3>
